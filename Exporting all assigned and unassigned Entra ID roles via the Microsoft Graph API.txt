
Exporting all assigned and unassigned Entra ID roles via the Microsoft Graph API involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide to help you through the process:

Prerequisites
1. Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license.
2. Admin consent for using Graph Explorer or Microsoft Graph API.
3. Microsoft Graph PowerShell module installed.

Steps to Export Entra ID Roles

#1. Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module
If you haven't already installed the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module, you can do so using the following command:

Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser


#2. Connect to Microsoft Graph
You need to connect to Microsoft Graph with the necessary permissions:

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "RoleManagement.Read.Directory", "Directory.Read.All"


#3. Export Roles Using PowerShell Script
Here's a PowerShell script to export all assigned and unassigned roles:


# Connect to Microsoft Graph
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "RoleManagement.Read.Directory", "Directory.Read.All"

# Get all role definitions
$Roles = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleDefinition -All

# Initialize an array to store role assignments
$RoleAssignments = @()

# Loop through each role and get assignments
foreach ($role in $Roles) {
    $Assignments = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment -Filter "roleDefinitionId eq '$($role.Id)'" -All
    foreach ($assignment in $Assignments) {
        $RoleAssignments += [pscustomobject]@{
            RoleName = $role.DisplayName
            PrincipalName = $assignment.Principal.DisplayName
            PrincipalType = $assignment.Principal.Type
            AssignmentType = "Assigned"
        }
    }

    # Check for unassigned roles
    if ($Assignments.Count -eq 0) {
        $RoleAssignments += [pscustomobject]@{
            RoleName = $role.DisplayName
            PrincipalName = "None"
            PrincipalType = "None"
            AssignmentType = "Unassigned"
        }
    }
}

# Export the role assignments to a CSV file
$RoleAssignments | Export-Csv -Path "C:\Path\To\Your\ExportedRoles.csv" -NoTypeInformation


Detailed Explanation
1. Connect to Microsoft Graph: This step ensures you have the necessary permissions to read role assignments.
2. Get Role Definitions: The script retrieves all role definitions in your Entra ID.
3. Get Role Assignments: It loops through each role to get the assignments and checks for unassigned roles.
4. Create a Report: It combines the data into a single report.
5. Export to CSV: Finally, the report is exported to a CSV file for easy viewing and analysis.
