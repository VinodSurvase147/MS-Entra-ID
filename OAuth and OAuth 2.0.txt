OAuth (Open Authorization) is a standard protocol that allows a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user, without sharing the user's credentials. OAuth 2.0, the latest version, replaced OAuth 1.0 in 2012 and is now the industry standard for online authorization[1](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2).

How OAuth 2.0 Works

OAuth 2.0 involves several key roles and steps:

1. Roles:
   - Resource Owner: The user who owns the data or resource.
   - Client: The application requesting access to the resource.
   - Authorization Server: The server that authenticates the user and issues access tokens.
   - Resource Server: The server hosting the protected resources, which accepts and validates access tokens.

2. Steps:
   - Authorization Request: The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
   - Authorization Grant: The resource owner grants authorization, typically through a consent screen.
   - Access Token Request: The client requests an access token from the authorization server using the authorization grant.
   - Access Token Response: The authorization server issues an access token to the client.
   - Resource Request: The client uses the access token to request the protected resource from the resource server.
   - Resource Response: The resource server validates the access token and returns the requested resource.

OAuth 2.0 Flows

OAuth 2.0 supports several authorization flows to accommodate different use cases:

1. Authorization Code Flow:
   - Use-Case: Web applications where the client can securely store a client secret.
   - Example: A web app requesting access to a user's Google Calendar.

2. Implicit Flow:
   - Use-Case: Single-page applications (SPAs) where the client cannot securely store a client secret.
   - Example: A JavaScript app accessing a user's profile information.

3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow:
   - Use-Case: Trusted applications where the client can directly handle user credentials.
   - Example: A mobile app where the user directly enters their username and password.

4. Client Credentials Flow:
   - Use-Case: Server-to-server communication where no user is involved.
   - Example: A backend service accessing another service's API.

5. Device Code Flow:
   - Use-Case: Devices with limited input capabilities.
   - Example: A smart TV requesting access to a user's streaming service account.

6. Refresh Token Flow:
   - Use-Case: Obtaining a new access token using a refresh token without re-authenticating the user.
   - Example: A web app maintaining a user's session without requiring them to log in again.

Use-Cases of OAuth 2.0

1. Third-Party App Integration:
   - Scenario: Allowing third-party apps to access user data without sharing passwords.
   - Example: A fitness app accessing a user's health data from a wearable device.

2. Single Sign-On (SSO):
   - Scenario: Enabling users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
   - Example: Using Google or Facebook login to access various web services.

3. API Access:
   - Scenario: Securing API endpoints by requiring access tokens.
   - Example: A developer accessing a cloud service's API to manage resources.

4. Delegated Access:
   - Scenario: Allowing users to delegate access to their resources to other users or services.
   - Example: A project management tool allowing team members to access shared documents.

Example: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

1. User Initiates Login: The user clicks "Login with Google" on a web app.
2. Authorization Request: The web app redirects the user to Google's authorization server.
3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in to Google and grants permission to the web app.
4. Authorization Code: Google redirects the user back to the web app with an authorization code.
5. Access Token Request: The web app exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
6. Access Token Response: Google issues an access token to the web app.
7. API Request: The web app uses the access token to request the user's profile information from Google's API.
8. API Response: Google returns the user's profile information to the web app.
