What is WS-Fed in Entra ID and how it works and what are the different use-cases when to use WS-Fed?

What is WS-Federation (WS-Fed) in Entra ID?

WS-Federation (WS-Fed) is a protocol used for identity federation and single sign-on (SSO) in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). It allows users to authenticate with their existing credentials from a trusted identity provider (IdP) and access resources in another domain without needing to re-enter their credentials.

How WS-Fed Works

1. User Requests Access: A user attempts to access a resource that requires authentication.
2. Redirection to IdP: The user is redirected to the WS-Fed identity provider (IdP) for authentication.
3. Authentication: The IdP authenticates the user using their existing credentials.
4. Token Issuance: Upon successful authentication, the IdP issues a security token containing the user's identity information and claims.
5. Token Validation: The security token is sent back to the relying party (the resource the user is trying to access), which validates the token.
6. Access Granted: If the token is valid, the user is granted access to the resource.

Use-Cases for WS-Fed

1. B2B Collaboration:
   - Scenario: An organization wants to allow external partners to access internal resources using their own corporate credentials.
   - Benefit: Simplifies access management and enhances security by leveraging existing identity systems.

2. Single Sign-On (SSO):
   - Scenario: Users need to access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
   - Benefit: Improves user experience and productivity by reducing the need for multiple logins.

3. Legacy Application Integration:
   - Scenario: Integrating older applications that support WS-Fed but not newer protocols like SAML or OAuth.
   - Benefit: Enables modern identity management for legacy systems without extensive re-engineering.

4. Cross-Domain Access:
   - Scenario: Users need to access resources across different domains or organizations.
   - Benefit: Facilitates seamless access across organizational boundaries.

Setting Up WS-Fed in Entra ID

#1. Register the Application
First, register the application in Microsoft Entra ID:


Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All"

$appDetails = @{
    "displayName" = "MyWSFedApp"
    "signInAudience" = "AzureADMyOrg"  # Single-tenant
}

$app = New-MgApplication -BodyParameter $appDetails
$app


#2. Configure WS-Fed Settings
Next, configure the WS-Fed settings for the application:


$wsFedSettings = @{
    "identifierUris" = @("https://mywsfedapp.com")
    "replyUrls" = @("https://mywsfedapp.com/wsfed")
    "wsFedEndpoint" = "https://mywsfedapp.com/wsfed"
}

Update-MgApplication -ApplicationId $app.Id -BodyParameter $wsFedSettings


#3. Add Claims Mapping Policy
Create and assign a claims mapping policy to the application:


$claimsMappingPolicy = @{
    "definition" = @(
        @{
            "ClaimsMappingPolicy" = @{
                "Version" = 1
                "IncludeBasicClaimSet" = $true
                "ClaimsSchema" = @(
                    @{
                        "Source" = "user"
                        "ID" = "userPrincipalName"
                        "SamlClaimType" = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"
                    }
                )
            }
        }
    )
    "displayName" = "WSFedClaimsMappingPolicy"
    "isOrganizationDefault" = $false
}

$policy = New-MgPolicyClaimsMappingPolicy -BodyParameter $claimsMappingPolicy
Add-MgServicePrincipalPolicy -ServicePrincipalId $app.Id -Id $policy.Id


#4. Assign Users to the Application
Assign users or groups to the application to enable access:


$userId = "user-object-id"
$servicePrincipalId = (Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$($app.AppId)'").Id

New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -PrincipalId $userId -ResourceId $servicePrincipalId -AppRoleId "role-id"
