Prerequisites
1. Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license.
2. Admin consent for using Graph Explorer or Microsoft Graph API.
3. Microsoft Graph PowerShell module installed.

Steps to Create Access Packages

#1. Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module
If you haven't already installed the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module, you can do so using the following command:

Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser


#2. Connect to Microsoft Graph
You need to connect to Microsoft Graph with the necessary permissions:

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All"


#3. Create an Access Package
Here’s a PowerShell script to create an access package:


# Connect to Microsoft Graph
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All"

# Define the access package details
$accessPackage = @{
    "displayName" = "Marketing Campaign Access"
    "description" = "Access package for marketing campaign resources"
    "catalogId" = "catalog-id"  # Replace with your catalog ID
    "isHidden" = $false
}

# Create the access package
$createdAccessPackage = New-MgEntitlementManagementAccessPackage -BodyParameter $accessPackage

# Output the created access package details
$createdAccessPackage


Detailed Explanation
1. Connect to Microsoft Graph: This step ensures you have the necessary permissions to create access packages.
2. Define Access Package Details: Specify the details of the access package, including the display name, description, catalog ID, and visibility.
3. Create the Access Package: Use the `New-MgEntitlementManagementAccessPackage` cmdlet to create the access package with the specified details.

Additional Steps
After creating the access package, you might want to add resources and configure policies:

#4. Add Resources to the Access Package
You can add resources such as groups, applications, and SharePoint sites to the access package. Here’s an example of adding a group:


# Define the resource details
$resource = @{
    "resourceId" = "group-id"  # Replace with your group ID
    "resourceType" = "Group"
}

# Add the resource to the access package
Add-MgEntitlementManagementAccessPackageResourceRole -AccessPackageId $createdAccessPackage.Id -BodyParameter $resource


#5. Configure Access Package Policies
You can configure policies for the access package, such as who can request access and the approval workflow. Here’s an example of creating a policy:

# Define the policy details
$policy = @{
    "displayName" = "Marketing Campaign Policy"
    "description" = "Policy for marketing campaign access package"
    "requestorSettings" = @{
        "scopeType" = "AllExistingConnectedDirectorySubjects"
        "requestorType" = "User"
    }
    "approvalSettings" = @{
        "isApprovalRequired" = $true
        "isApprovalRequiredForExtension" = $false
        "approvalStages" = @(
            @{
                "stageNumber" = 1
                "approvers" = @(
                    @{
                        "principalId" = "approver-id"  # Replace with your approver ID
                        "principalType" = "User"
                    }
                )
            }
        )
    }
}

# Create the policy
New-MgEntitlementManagementAccessPackageAssignmentPolicy -AccessPackageId $createdAccessPackage.Id -BodyParameter $policy
